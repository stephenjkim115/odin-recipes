        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Scrambled eggs are cheap, easy-to-make, nutritious, and delicious. I learned the recipe below from my good friends in college.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>sea salt, to taste</li>
            <li>ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>sesame oil, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat pan on stovetop to medium heat. Add olive oil and spread around pan.</li>
            <li>Turn down heat to low-medium and add eggs. As eggs are cooking, use a spatula to consistently and gently prevent the eggs from fully cooking.</li>
            <li>Eventually, despite your mixing, the eggs will begin to solidify. Add salt,pepper, and sesame oil (to taste) at this point.</li>
            <li>Before the eggs look completely cooked, remove the pan from the stovetop. The residual heat will cook the remainder of the eggs.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
